# Day-2-of-Learning-Java
In the day 2 I have learn about the basic of java and made the program of some problems based on { Type Casting(Implicit &amp; Explicit ),If-Else Statement(basic conditions),Loop &amp; Pattern Printing(using for loop), Pattern Matching (String Matching),Advanced Pattern Printing(Nested Loops ) }.

The problems are as following:-

Q6. Type Casting:-
Create a program to demonstrate implicit and explicit type casting between int, double, and float.

Q7. If-Else Statement:-
Take an integer input from the user and check:
 If the number is:
 (a)positive
 (b)negative 
 (c)zero.
 
Q8. Loop & Pattern Printing:-
 Print the right inverted traingle pattern using a loop.
 
Q9. Pattern Matching (String Matching):-
 Take two strings as input from the user. Check if the second string is a substring of the first string. Print "Match Found" or "No Match".
 
Q10. Advanced Pattern Printing (Nested Loops):-
 Print the following number pattern:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
